# Gantt Chart App

## Project motivation

It actually started with my wife's needs for a simple dashboard app. She is a good part of an opening project for a property and wanted to have a tool to plan and track her project works.

The existing gantt chart apps cost too much for a personal use, or are hard for me understand their logics so I decided to build for my own.

## Tools

I will be making a react component using [Google Charts](https://react-google-charts.com/gantt-chart) as it provides a good framework for gantt chart visualization which can be rendered in JavaScript.
